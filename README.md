# subsystems code
Code for making bioinformatics work with the SEED subsystems database a little easier.

Useful link - the FTP Seed site, Subsystems folder: ftp://ftp.theseed.org/subsystems/

## contents
* Subsystems_simplifier.py - takes the "subsystems.complex" big file and makes it into a bioinformatics-friendly layout (FASTA, suitable to be used by annnotation algorithms like BLAST and DIAMOND as a database)

More to come.
